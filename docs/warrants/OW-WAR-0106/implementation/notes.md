# Hotline implementation progress

The first library component defines exact question and answer records. Questions
bind the controller-provided source identity, policy digest and observed committed
checkpoint. Answer authentication derives the responder from a configured token
hash; request bodies cannot nominate their own actor. Governing response scope is
explicit per Warrant. A direct-human request additionally requires a configured
human responder. Delegated AI governing scope does not award a human signature or
qualification. Empty responder configuration grants nobody permission.

Four direct contract tests cover valid answer binding, mutable-input isolation,
stale subject and policy differences, actor injection, credential refusal,
governing scope, direct-human distinction, invalid checkpoints, qualification
injection, duplicate credentials and wildcard scope refusal.

These are library observations only. HTTP storage, responder routing, browser
controls, checkpoint/resume lifecycle, cumulative budgets and integration tests
remain unfinished. No runtime completion or security deployment is claimed.
Bearer credential custody belongs to the configured harness/operator; a token
hash is not proof of human presence or secure acceptance.

Execution now accepts oh.war/execution-question/v1 only after successful harness
exit and a clean committed checkpoint descended from the configured base. It
retains the question in the stopped, blocked attempt. Ordinary start refuses to
bypass that question. A real HTTP/process/Git test observed checkpoint retention,
restart persistence, absent completion signal and admission/start refusal. The
38-test execution suite passes. Answer delivery and explicit resume remain open.
