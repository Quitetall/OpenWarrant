# Assurance

## Acceptance Obligations

### OBL-001 — the bounded result is observed
- **scope:** rc2_probe --all plus public-boundary integration tests and the repository aggregate gate; F01, F02, F03, F04, F05, F06, F07, F08, F09, F10, F11, T01, T02, T03, T04, T05, T06, T07, T08, T09, T10, T11, T12, T13, T14, T15, T16, T17, T18, T19, T20, T21, T22, T23, T24, T25, T26, T27, T28, T29, T30, T31, T32, T33, T34, T35, T36, T37, T38, T39, T40, T41, T42, T43, T44, T45, T46, T47, T48, T49, T50, T51, T52, T53, T54, T55, T56.
- **evidence:** All eleven features and all 56 cases report fixture digests, observed results and matched expectations with no skips; focused tests and cargo xtask gate pass on the pinned toolchain. An independent reviewer reproduces the direct-driver runs.

### OBL-002 — the controls reject their stated counterexamples
- **scope:** the refusal cases within rc2_probe --all plus public-boundary integration tests and the repository aggregate gate.
- **evidence:** Deleting a case, returning constant success, dispatching on fixture names or removing required assertions must make the test harness fail. A legacy regression or unavailable required check cannot be recorded as PASS.

### OBL-003 — independent evidence supports acceptance of the exact result
- **scope:** this Warrant's final deliverable revision and the two obligations above.
- **evidence:** a separate verifier reproduces required observations, reviews exact source/fixture/build digests and reports bounded findings; the authorized human accepts or resolves through the applicable process. Performer tests alone cannot establish this obligation.

### OBL-004 — the delivered Warrant records remain structurally valid
- **scope:** this Warrant's authored records and their current repository references; no claim of runtime feature correctness.
- **gate:** `gate://software.repo.war-check@1.0.0`
- **evidence:** a recorded run of the qualified structural gate on the exact deliverable revision, with its existing planted controls retained. A named fixture/schema violation is refused in a disposable corpus; a structural pass cannot satisfy OBL-001 or OBL-002 by itself.

## Gate Adequacy

All observations above are required and currently NOT RUN for this new Warrant.
No disposition is declared. `war check` checks draft structure, not feature
correctness. `war check --generated` checks generated consistency, not runtime
conformance. Functional commands must capture command, exit, exact inputs,
observed output and revision; an expected refusal passes its test only when
the named refusal is observed. Missing cases and unknown checks cannot pass.

For library slices, use the documented future rc2_probe --feature command and
public-boundary integration tests. For phase exits, run the documented full
inventory and cargo xtask gate on the pinned toolchain. Register/qualify any
new executable gate before citing it as an authoritative gate result; this
draft invents no gate qualification. Evidence admissibility and independent
verification remain prerequisites for resolution in addition to the separately bounded structural gate above.

**Adversarial question:** can constant success, a fixture lookup table, copied
performer assertions, or an unobserved check satisfy these obligations? No:
the named mutations/refusals, exact input identities and independent reproduction
must establish the bounded behavior. Failures remain visible until repaired or
properly dispositioned by an authorized independent actor.

## Planned direct acceptance commands

```bash
# Future driver; the aggregate repository command already exists.
cargo run -p openwarrant-compiler --example rc2_probe -- --all --fixtures conformance/rc2
cargo xtask gate
```
