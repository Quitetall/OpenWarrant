# Basis

## Governing text

The current accepted SAS and existing ADRs govern this draft's preparation.
The implementation target is SAS 1.0.0-rc.2 and its format contract, currently
an unaccepted candidate. The candidate source-set manifest SHA-256 is
`201b707e9657a3c6674ea113a018a34a54b5ab425f37c417c8968af9f4d2cf31`. Candidate feature/case IDs below are prospective scope,
not claims that the active legacy SAS already contains those meanings.

## Required context

- Candidate SAS, format contract, phase-1-build-scope and the exact relevant
  source-set entries: retain binding text and referenced definitions/exceptions.
- Existing module boundaries named in the work order, plus applicable ADRs and
  resolved-delivery pins, re-inspected before implementation.
- Test seam: parse_document and validate_document through rc2_probe.
- Scoped inventory: F01, F02, T01, T02, T03, T04, T05, T06, T07, T08, T09, T10.

## Prerequisites

Required predecessor outputs: OW-WAR-0074.
Execution needs the applicable governing basis and this Warrant's authorization.
Cross-Warrant prerequisites are manual holds stated in recognized blocking
assumptions in rationale.toml and in the roadmap's planning index. The current
Assumption parser has no external_dependency field and no automatic predecessor
resolver. Status/closure can expose a blocking unknown, but this is not execution
fencing. Current frontier only orders stages inside this Warrant; an OPEN stage
is not permission to start. The authorizer and performer must inspect the holds.
Retire a blocking assumption only on the stated evidence through the applicable
revision process. Do not require unrelated legacy Warrants to be closed.
