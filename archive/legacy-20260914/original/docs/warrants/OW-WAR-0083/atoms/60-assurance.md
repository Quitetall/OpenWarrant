# Assurance

## Acceptance Obligations

### OBL-001 — the bounded result is observed
- **scope:** check_records, evaluate_readiness and evaluate_assurance over supplied facts; F09, T42, T43, T44, T45, T46, T47, T48.
- **evidence:** T42-T48 distinguish human-granted prototype execution, unreviewed finished work, later qualification, exact-revision acceptance and stronger repository baseline requirements.

### OBL-002 — the controls reject their stated counterexamples
- **scope:** the refusal cases within check_records, evaluate_readiness and evaluate_assurance over supplied facts.
- **evidence:** A performer assertion, missing human acceptance, stale revision or missing independent evidence cannot yield the human-backed assurance mark; unknown facts remain unknown. Automated policy drafts do not grant themselves effective permissions.

### OBL-003 — independent evidence supports acceptance of the exact result
- **scope:** this Warrant's final deliverable revision and the two obligations above.
- **evidence:** a separate verifier reproduces required observations, reviews exact source/fixture/build digests and reports bounded findings; the authorized human accepts or resolves through the applicable process. Performer tests alone cannot establish this obligation.

### OBL-004 — the delivered Warrant records remain structurally valid
- **scope:** this Warrant's authored records and their current repository references; no claim of runtime feature correctness.
- **gate:** `gate://software.repo.war-check@1.0.0`
- **evidence:** a recorded run of the qualified structural gate on the exact deliverable revision, with its existing planted controls retained. A named fixture/schema violation is refused in a disposable corpus; a structural pass cannot satisfy OBL-001 or OBL-002 by itself.

## Gate Adequacy

All observations above are required and currently NOT RUN for this new Warrant.
No disposition is declared. `war check` checks draft structure, not feature
correctness. `war check --generated` checks generated consistency, not runtime
conformance. Functional commands must capture command, exit, exact inputs,
observed output and revision; an expected refusal passes its test only when
the named refusal is observed. Missing cases and unknown checks cannot pass.

For library slices, use the documented future rc2_probe --feature command and
public-boundary integration tests. For phase exits, run the documented full
inventory and cargo xtask gate on the pinned toolchain. Register/qualify any
new executable gate before citing it as an authoritative gate result; this
draft invents no gate qualification. Evidence admissibility and independent
verification remain prerequisites for resolution in addition to the separately bounded structural gate above.

**Adversarial question:** can constant success, a fixture lookup table, copied
performer assertions, or an unobserved check satisfy these obligations? No:
the named mutations/refusals, exact input identities and independent reproduction
must establish the bounded behavior. Failures remain visible until repaired or
properly dispositioned by an authorized independent actor.

## Planned direct acceptance commands

These commands become runnable only when this slice is implemented.

```bash
cargo run -p openwarrant-compiler --example rc2_probe -- --feature F09 --fixtures conformance/rc2
```
